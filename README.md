Bento is a collection of free and open source microservices used to construct data-focused platforms, developed by the
[Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics](https://computationalgenomics.ca/) in Montr√©al.

By adhering to existing and anticipated standardized APIs, it facilitates interactions between 
various -omic science global communities. Its reusable and interoperable components reduce the 
complexity and overhead of constructing data distribution portals.


## Docker-based development and deployment tooling

This repository contains configuration and a command-line utility for deploying
the Bento platform using `docker compose`, and for developing the various services
that make up the Bento platform.

## Requirements
- Docker >= 27.3
- Docker Compose >= 2.40.2 (plugin form: you should have the `docker compose` command available, without a dash)
  - Version 2.40.2 addressed a
    [major security vulnerability](https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts-advisories/docker-security-advisory-av25-708)
    in Compose, and is the minimum required version.
- Python >= 3.10 (for `bentoctl`); the services require Python 3.12 but this is included in their Docker images.
