## bentoV2
This repo is intended to be the next generation of Bento deployments.
Originating from the blueprints in the repo `chord_singularity`, `bentoV2` aims to be much more modular than it's counterpart, built with docker instead of Singularity.

## Makefile
The Makefile contains a set of tools to faciliate testing, development, and deployments. Ranging from `build`, `run`, and `clean` commands, operators may have an easier time using these rather than fiddling with raw `docker` and `docker-compose` commands.

## Requirements
- Docker >= 19.03.8
- Docker Compose >=1.25.0
